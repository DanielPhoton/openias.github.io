The Open Institute for Advanced Study is so far just a blog with ideas about collaborative research.

But as the pompous name implies the underlying ambition is almost limitless: to explore the
opportunity to create an online institute, modeled after the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study
in that it is not a graduate school training students in the known and in the methods of research,
but rather an institute where everyone takes for granted what is known and published, and, each in
their own individual way, endeavor to advance the frontiers of knowledge. If ever created this nascent
institute would distinguish itself from those before it by welcoming everyone to join its ranks, work
collaboratively on research and partake in the scientific discussion, whether they are a tenured
professor or still in high school.
